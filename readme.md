A simple word-chain "game" with Vue.

How to use it?

git clone https://github.com/Bazsmagister/WordChain_Vue.git

start a server:
if you have php on your machine:
php -S localhost:3000

(3000 is the port number. Choose one above 1024. for example 8080.
This port is a popular alternative to port 80 for offering web services. "8080" was chosen since it is "two 80's", and also because it is above the restricted well known service port range (ports 1-1023).

or if you have python:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

I created an alias for it:
alias pythonserver='python -m SimpleServer 8000'
alias phpserver='php -S localhost:3000'

put is in your .bash_aliases file in linux. then source the file to use it.
or if you use zshell, even with oh-my-zsh , then you can put these aliases in .zshrc
